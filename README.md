# Landing-Page

This is my attempt to recreat a landing page from just a pciture and a few aspects that was given to me for this project.

I seperated each section into their own sections so I could be more organized and work on one part of the page at a time. 

What I learned from this project was a better understanding of html and css. The hardest part was naming the selectors. Yeah I imagine there is an easier way to this porject but learning fro experience was the best part. Google is indeed our friend.
